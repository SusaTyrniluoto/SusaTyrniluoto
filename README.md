Hi! I'm a visual artist, photographer, and visual designer who's currently diving deeper into the world of coding and web development.

I'm familiar with platforms like Ghost, WordPress, Outsystems, and Bubble, and have created several websites using these tools. Additionally, I have practical experience with programming languages and web development technologies including C, Python, Swift, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and visual programming environments like VUO and Max. I've also done small projects using React and Typescript.

Languages:
- Finnish: native, excellent communication skills
- English: excellent written, good spoken
- Swedish: good written, fair spoken
