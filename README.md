Hi, I’m visual artist @SusaTyrniluoto

I am using traditional fine art methods lika drawing, painting (oil and acrylic), digital image design and printing (Photoshop, Lightroom, vector graphics, fine art printing, large format printing, ceramic glass printing), sculpture (bronze sculptures, VR-assisted 3D modelling, Rhinoceros), video production, animation in 2D and 3D (vuo.org, Max8)

I’m currently working with art projects and studying Python, Arduino (C-language), Blender sculpting
